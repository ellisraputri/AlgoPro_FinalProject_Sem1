"Hmm, this place is a bit strange."
"Hey, who are you and why are you in my house?!"
A prestigious man stood in front of that boy.
"I was looking for some things and I accidentally stumbled into your house, Sir."
"I'm really sorry. I thought this house was empty."
"What are you looking for?"
The boy showed the scroll to that man.
"Ah, I see. I know these things."
"Really?! Could you tell me more about it?"
"Of course. Let me help you..."
The man suddenly took out his weapon and attacked the boy.
"Wait, why are you attacking me?"
The man didn't answer the boy.
"Hey! Answer me! Don't just blindly attack me."
The man still didn't react to the boy.
Unwillingly, the boy started to fight back against the man.
