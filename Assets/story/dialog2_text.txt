"Huft..." 
"I managed to get the werewolf hearts."
The boy heaved a long sigh of relief.
"Now, the hard part is over."
"I just need to find some more items."
The boy looked at the list that the vampire gave him.
"Oh no, I don't know most of the items."
"Now, where can I find them?"
Suddenly, the boy saw a ruined house not far from him.
  
"Maybe I could find something in there!"
He then went in without a second thought.
