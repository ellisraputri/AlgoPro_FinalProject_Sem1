The boy woke up from a deep slumber. 
"Where am I? Why am I in the forest?!" 
He looked left and right, trying to find someone he knew. 
* thud * 
"Hello, young boy." 
A vampire with a mysterious aura looking down at that little boy. 
"Do you want to know what is going on here?" 
"Yes! Yes of course! Please tell me!" 
"I will tell you about it."   
"But first, you need to find some things for me."
"What things do I need to find?" 
"Three kinds of werewolf heart and this list of items." 
   
"If you can find those things, I will tell you what you want to know."
After saying that, the vampire vanished.
The boy is confused. He doesn't know if he can believe the vampire or not.
But, he doesn't have choices. He wants to know what happened.
He gripped his hand tightly and started his journey into the forest.
