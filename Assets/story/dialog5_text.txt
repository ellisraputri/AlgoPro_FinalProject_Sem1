"Huft, finally, I got all the things I needed."
"Now, I just need to find that female vampire."
"Well, hello boy, I heard you have found all the things I want."
"HUH??! Wait, when did you come here?!"
"It's not important. Give me the things."
The boy nodded and gave the vampire all the things she wanted.
"Now, could you give me my answer?"
"What actually happened here?"
Hearing that, the vampire laughed loudly.
"What happened here? Oh yeah, I did promise you that."
"The truth is that I have killed all of the people."
"You, the lucky one, that I missed."
"So, I might as well use you to obtain these things for me."
"In other words, you're nothing more than a pawn in my hand."
The boy fell silent. He couldn't believe what he just heard.
After a while, he tilted his head and shot the vampire with his fiery eyes.
"YOU!! GO TO HELL!!!"
"Oh? You want to fight?"
"Sure, I wanted to kill you anyway."
"But, before that,"
The vampire casts magic around the items that the boy found earlier.
Then, she turned into twice more bigger than before.
"let me show you the ultimate nightmare."
