"Now, tell me why did you attack me."
"You met that female vampire, right? That's my sister."
"That still doesn't explain why you attack me!"
"Let me finish my words first. We both hate each other."
"And, those things you're looking for are my sister's belongings."
"So, I want to fail her plans."
"In other words, you know these things' locations?"
"Yes, they're only upstairs."
"Okay thank you."
"Be careful, young boy. Don't trust her too much."
"I know what I'm doing."
The man smiled bitterly while vanishing bit by bit into thin air.
"May you rest in peace."
The boy then continued his journey.
