The boy woke up from a deep slumber.
"Where am I?"
He looked left and right, trying to find someone he knew.
* thud *
"Hello, young boy."
A vampire with a monstrous aura looking down at that little boy.
"Do you want to know what is happening here?"
"Yes! Yes of course! Please tell me!"
"I will tell you about it." 
"But, you need to find some things for me first."
"What things do I need to find?"
"Three werewolf hearts and ten golden mugs."
"If you have found those things, come back to me again."
"I will tell you all of the truths."
After saying that, the vampire disappeared.
The boy is confused. He doesn't know if he can believe the vampire or not.
But, he doesn't have a choice. He wants to know what is happening right now.
He then gripped his hand tightly and started his journey into the forest.
